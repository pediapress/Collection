You can collect articles, generate and download a PDF file from article collections or from single articles and save article collections for later use or to share them. 

== Add and remove articles ==

When you are on an article page, you see a small box titled "collections" on the left. Here you can add the current article (in the currently shown revision) to your collection. If the article has previously been added to the collection you can remove it instead.

== Manage the collection ==

Click "Show collection" to go to the [[Special:Collection]]. Here you can manage your collection:
* enter a title and a subtitle for the collection
* create chapters
* rearrange the articles and chapters in the collection
* remove articles and chapters from your collection
* sort the collection (chapter-wise)

== Download PDF files ==

To download a PDF version of a single article, just go to the article page and click on the "Download as PDF" inside the toolbox on the left.

To download an entire collection as a PDF file, go to the [[Special:Collection]] page and click the "Download PDF" button.

== Save and load collections ==

You have to be [[Special:Userlogin|logged-in]] to save a collection. Go to the [[Special:Collection]] page, choose whether you want to save the collection as a subpage of your userpage or as a subpage of Wikipedia:Collections, enter a title and click the save button. Collections are automatically added to the [[:Category:Collections|Collections category]].

If you are on a collection page, the "collections" portlet on the left contains a "Load collection" link to load the shown collection.

== Format of saved collection pages ==

A collection with title "My Collection" and subtitle "Just an Example" consisting of two chapters "Foo" and "Bar" each containing three articles will be saved as a page with the following [[wikitext]]:
